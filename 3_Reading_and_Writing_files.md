# Reading and Writing files

## Files we need

Note: you have to save the file in the same directory that your cmd line window is in.


### Fasta file

Save the following in a file called "hbb.fsa".

```

We are now going to see how we can read and write to files. Note: use Notepad++ to write the script, save it as translate.py and run it with python27.

## Creating a codon table

We are now going to read in the "translationtable.txt" file, and create a dictionary from it.

```python
import sys
fh = open(sys.argv[1], "r") # the translation table file
lines = fh.readlines()
print(lines)
print(len(lines))
fh.close()
```

Question: How many entries does it contain?   
Question: Can you tell whether the table is tab separated, or if there are just spaces in between the entries?  

Next, we are going to use a for loop to read in all the entries into a dictionary, with the codons as the key, and the amino acid as the value. 

Remove the print lines in the code above, and add the following code below:

```python
codon_table = {}
for line in lines:
    without_newline = line.replace("\n", "")
    fields = without_newline.split()
    codon = fields[0]
    aminoacid = fields[1]
    codon_table[codon] = aminoacid
print(codon_table)
```

But note: you will see that you actually also get the first line of the file in here - this is no codon-amino acid pair. 

Question: How do you skip the first line when passing through the input file lines? See the slides on how to process blast output to figure this out. Hint: this involves slicing.   

Repeat the above code without the first line, and see what you get.

Question: how would you iterate over the dictionary and show all codon-amino acid pairs?   
 
## Reading in a fasta file

We now have a codon to amino acid mapping dictionary. The file "hbb.fsa" that you saved above is the mRNA sequence for hemoglobin subunit B. Let's try to translate that into protein.

First, we need to read in the file. Remove the print statement from the code above, and add this to your script file:

```python
fh = open(sys.argv[2], "r") # now need to add the hbb.fsa file to the command line.
lines = fh.readlines()
print(lines)
fh.close()
```

So, now we have a list containing all of the lines in this file. Now we need to get this into one string containing the mRNA. This means removing any newlines, gluing each line of text together with the others, and storing this text as the variable mRNA. 

Below is the code necessary to read in the fasta file, with some text replaced with underscores. Figure out how this should be and add the following to your existing script. Remember, remove any print statements from the code above first.

```python
mRNA = "" # create empty string to contain the mRNA
for line __ lines[__]:
	text = line.replace(____, __)
	mRNA = mRNA + ____
print(mRNA)
```

Question: what are we removing from the variable line, and why?

Question: One of the things that have been left for you to fill out is something after the name of the list in the for loop. What have we left out here? And, most importantly, why?

Question: after we have translated the DNA string, we will want to print it out to a new file, with the original heading. Where would we find that, and how could we store that for later?

## Translate proteins

So, now we have the translation table, and the mRNA. Now we are going to translate it to protein. What we do here is to slice the mRNA into codons and use them to look up the amino acid in the codon table. Then, we stick that onto the string that contains the protein. 

Again the code below has some underscores in it that has to be replaced. A lot of this are things you saw in the previous exercise. Figure out what goes instead of the underscore and place this code below the rest of what you already have. Also, remove any print statements above this code.

```python
protein = ""
dnalen = len(____)-2
numbers = range(0, ____, 3)  # start, stop, step size
for index in _______:
    codon = mRNA[_____:index+3]
    aa = codon_table[_____]
    protein = _______ + aa
print(protein)
```
Question: what are we subtracting from the length of the mRNA? What is the consequence of this?
Question: what happens in the three lines inside the for loop?

## Printing the results to file. 

Last, but not least, let's get this output to file. Let's first figure out how to get it nicely formatted. In this case, in our file we should have a header line followed by the amino acids, 60 per line. 

```python
output = lines[0] # we first add the header from the mRNA file
proteinlen = len(protein)
numbers = range(0, proteinlen, 60)  # start, stop, step size
for index in numbers:
    output = output + protein[index:index+60] + "\n"
print(output)
```
Question: can you identify where in the code the fasta description line comes from?

So, now we have the output we want, and we can print it to a file. We first open it, then write to it, and then close it again. Again, remove any print statements.

```python
fo = open(sys.argv[3], "w") # output file name.
fo.write(output)
fo.close()
```
Regarding output file name: be sure to use the name of a file that does not exist! You can use the **more** command to look at the results.

Congratulations, you have now translated your very first protein!
