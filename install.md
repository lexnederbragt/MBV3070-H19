### Installing Python and Jupyter on your own laptop

If you want to run python and/or Jupyter Notebook on your own machine, we recommend installing Anaconda from Continuum Analytics. This is a free solution and gives you many useful applications and python modules.
Find your operating system at <a href="https://www.anaconda.com/download"> https://www.anaconda.com/download </a> and select `Python 3.7 version` and follow the instructions.
When the installation is complete you will find a new program called ‘Navigator’ or ‘Anaconda Navigator’. Start it and you get the opportunity to launch Jupyter Notebook, or Spyder (a program that helps you write and run Python code using script files instead of Jupyter Notebook).
