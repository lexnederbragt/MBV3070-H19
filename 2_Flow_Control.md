# Python 2 : Control flow - Boolean expressions, if statements and for loops.
## Howto

Note: for the first part of this exercise, use the interactive shell directly, and type in commands there. You can start the interpreter like this:

  * click the start button
  * type in cmd in the small window at the bottom
  * press enter

You will now have a black window on your screen. You can type things in here, after the arrow symbol. To run a python script, or to run the python interactive shell, type in **python27**.

For some exercises, the code is commented. Comments begin with a # sign, and anything after that is ignored. You do not need to type in the # and anything after.

## Boolean expressions

A basic element of programming is to be able to compare things, to see if they are equal or if one is larger or smaller than another. Many of the ways of comparing things are similar to those found in other languages.

```Python
a = 1
b = 2
print(a == b) # are the two the same?
print(a < b) # is a less than b?
print(a <= b) # is a less than or equal to b?
print(a > b) # is a larger than b?
print(a >= b) # is a larger or greater than b?
print(a != b) # is a not equal to b?
```

Note, we can also test the results of doing something, like this:

```Python
word = "Hello"
print(len(word) < 10) # is the length of this word shorter than 10?
beatles=["George", "Ringo","John", "Paul"]
print(len(beatles) == 4) # are there four members in beatles?
```

However, python has other equivalence test statements that are fairly
unique to python. To check whether an object is contained in a list:

```Python
beatle="John"
beatles=["George", "Ringo","John", "Paul"]
print(beatle in beatles) # is John in the list beatles?
print("Tom" in beatles) # is there somebody in the list beatles called Tom?
```

We can also combine these with and, or and not. Let's see how this works:

```Python
beatle="John"		
beatles=["George", "Ringo","John", "Paul"]
print(beatle)
print(beatle in beatles)
print(len(beatles) == 4)
print(beatle in beatles and len(beatles) == 4) # is "John" in beatles, and are there four entries (members) in the beatles list?
print(len(beatles) > 4) # are there more than four members in the beatles list?
print(beatle in beatles or len(beatles) > 4) # is "John" in beatles, or are are there more than 4 members in the list?
print(len(beatles) > 3) # are there more than three members in the beatles list?
print(beatle in beatles or not len(beatles) >3)  # is "John" in beatles, or not more than 3 members in beathes
```

## If statements


If statements are a way to select which parts of a piece of code that should be run depending on a condition, something that turns out to be true or false. An if statement consists of one if, zero or more elifs and maybe one else. Look at the if statement below, and figure out which parts of the code that would be run, and what would be printed in the end.

To do the following part, exit the interactive shell by using Ctrl-z, and then pressing enter. Use Notepad++ to write things into a file, save it under a name that you choose (remember to have the file ending with .py), and then run it with 'python27 yourchosenfilename.py'. To run only one section of a program (parts of the code in a file), comment out what you don't want to run. Do that by putting a # in front of any lines that should not be run.


```Python
i = 4
sign = "zero"

if i < 0: #the if statement begins here
    sign = "negative"
elif i > 0:
    sign = "positive"
else:
    print("Sign must be zero")
    print("Have a nice day") # and ends here

print(sign)
```

Question: what is printed at the end when this piece of code is run?

Question: figure out what you need to change in order for this piece of code to print out "Sign must be zero" and "Have an nice day"?

Note, Python uses **indentation** to delimit code blocks. The indentation above is NOT just to make things look pretty - it tells Python what the body of the if-statement is. This is true whenever we create any code blocks.


### Task: GCdecider.py - Figuring out if a DNA string has more or less than 50 % GC content.

Use the slides from last week, and look at the exercises from last week too.

The goal for this task is to figure out if a piece of DNA contains more than 50% GCs or not. This basically means counting the number of Gs and Cs and figuring out if these together make up more than 50% of the number of nucleotides in the string.

Below is skeleton script that will do this. Save this in a file that you will name GCdecider.py. Figure out what each line of code should do, and fill in the missing text. Try to run it, does it work?

```Python
___ = "ATGGCATGGCATGGC"
g = dna._____("G")
c = ___.count(_)
gc = (g + c)*100.0/___(____)
if ______:
    print("GC content is above or equal to 50%")
else:
    print("GC content is below 50%")
```

## Getting input from the command line

Above, the text string you calculated the GC content on was writtien into the script, this is often called "hard coding" something into it. Let's say you want to try to calculate the GC content of another string. You could then change the script, but it would be a lot easier if you could do that without changing the script. You cand do that by using a special list that is called "sys.argv"

Create a script that is called "sys-test.py". Put the following content into it:

```Python
import sys
print(sys.argv)
for element in sys.argv:
    print(element)
print(sys.argv[1])
```
Run the commands shown below on the command line:

  * python27 sys-test.py 1
  * python27 sys-test first second
  * python27 sys-test.py 1 2 3 4
  * python27 sys-test.py

Question: can you figure out why the last one fails?

Can you now try to figure out how to change your GCdecider script so that you can do the following:

  * python27 GCdecider.py ATGGCCGGAGGGAGCCGGA

Hint: you need to include the first and the last line of the sys-test script.

## For Loops with lists

**for** loops in python are used to iterate over collections of things (they can be used for much more, but for now this definition will do).

Let's start with a very simple list, and see how **for** behaves. To do this part, go back to the interactive shell.

```Python
forlist = [1, 2 ,3,"a", 5, 9, "c"]
for elem in forlist:
    print(elem)
```

We can also create what is called nested for loops, this is when we have a loop within another one:

```Python
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
words = ["green plants", "yellow sun", "blue water"]
for num in numbers:
    for word in words:
        print(num, word)
```
Explain to yourself what happens here. How are the elements from each of the two lists combined?

## For Loops with Dictionaries

With a list, then, it's clear that we can use the **in** keyword to indicate a list of things, and that we can create nested loops. How do we use use for loops with dicionaries? The clue here is to remember that the keys in a dictionary work like a list.

```Python
codondict = {}
codondict["UUU"] = "F"
codondict["ACA"] = "T"
codondict["CGG"] = "R"
for key in codondict:
    print(key, codondict[key])
```
This way we see both the keys and their values.

range() - create list of numbers
===========

With the range command, we can create a list of numbers that we can use in for loops:

```Python
numbers = range(10)
print(numbers)
```

With this way of writing it, range will produce numbers from 0 to the number in the parenthesis.

We can also specify where it should start, and also the step size between the numbers:

```Python
numbers = range(0, 12, 3)  # start, stop, step size
print(numbers)
```

With this construct, we have a way of grabbing each codon in a piece of DNA:

```Python
dna = "ATGGCATGGCATGGC"
dnalen = len(dna)
numbers = range(0, dnalen, 3)  # start, stop, step size
print(numbers)
for index in numbers:
    print(dna[index:index+3])
```
We can now use this to translate a protein.

## Translate proteins

For this part, use Notepad++ and run your script on the command line.

Last week we translated proteins manually. Now, we can do it a bit more efficiently. First, let's define a dictionary which can translate between them, and a DNA string to translate:

```Python
import sys
codon_table = {"ATA":"I", "ATG":"M", "ACA":"T", \
               "AAC":"N", "CGA":"R", "CAG":"Q", "TGA": "*"}
dna = sys.argv[1]
```

First, define a new variable that will contain the protein string. Then we need a list of numbers that we can use to slice the string with. Next, we use a for loop to iterate over triplets of the string. We use each triplet as a key in the dictionary, and add the resulting amino acid to the protein string (concatenate them using +). Finally, print the string.

```Python
protein = ""
dnalen = len(dna)
numbers = range(0, dnalen, 3)  # start, stop, step size
for index in numbers:
    codon = dna[index:index+3]
    aa = codon_table[codon]
    protein = protein + aa
print(protein)
```

Try running this script with this string: ATGCAGAACATA


## Task: Stop at stop codon.

Let's say you have a different DNA string, ACACAGCGAAACTGAACAATG.

First, try running the script above with this string instead of the other one.

As you might see, you now get a stop codon in the code.

Figure out how you can use an if statement inside of the loop to skip over the stop codon. Hint: instead of focusing on what you do if you see that stop codon, focus on what you do if a codon is not a stop codon.
